## Development Environment

We have two options for setting up our development environment on Windows. Option A is to install Laravel Homestead, and the prerequisite requirements for it (Virtualbox & Vagrant). This option has traditionally been used to provide quick setup without needing to install additional dependencies on your machine.

Option B is to use Laragon, which is similar to XAMPP. This option is relatively new and has not been tested by our team yet. Choosing this option is fine, just know that some of the process and results are unknown to us. 

### Option A - Laravel Homestead

- [ ]  Install virtual box `choco install virtualbox`
- [ ]  Install vagrant `choco install vagrant`
- [ ]  Install homestead ([https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead))

### Option B - Laragon

- [ ]  Install Laragon `choco install laragon`
